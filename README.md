# adventofcode_2020

## Day 1:

I was unprepared to deal with text files. I was hoping I can download a copy using Python, but I don't see a way without authenticating to the site. Although, I came across wimglenn's [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data). I don't have time to get started on the first exercise, but my first solution would be to first sort the input file. Then create two tuples and attempt to multiply using a nested loop. I know, I know. Probably most overused, unsophisticated solutions. I'm not in this for speed, but for the challenges.
