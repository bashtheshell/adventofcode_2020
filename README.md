# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1:

I was unprepared to deal with text files. I was hoping I can download a copy using Python, but I don't see a way without authenticating to the site. Although, I came across wimglenn's [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data). I don't have time to get started on the first exercise, but my first solution would be to first sort the input file. Then create two tuples and attempt to sum using a nested loop. I know, I know. Probably most overused, unsophisticated solutions. I'm not in this for speed, but for the challenges.

**UPDATE:** Completed the two part exercises on day 3. I'm aware the solution could be taxing. Especially with large input file. I forgot to sort the tuples but then it'd be irrelevant with the shortcuts I took.

## Day 2:

I'm supposed to be on Day 3, but I'm a day behind. Just completed this exerise right before midnight of Day 4. The puzzle was very good. Although, Part 2 tricked me. I incorrectly answered it the first time, because I didn't read carefully.
