# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1:

I was unprepared to deal with text files. I was hoping I can download a copy using Python, but I don't see a way without authenticating to the site. Although, I came across wimglenn's [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data). I don't have time to get started on the first exercise, but my first solution would be to first sort the input file. Then create two tuples and attempt to sum using a nested loop. I know, I know. Probably most overused, unsophisticated solutions. I'm not in this for speed, but for the challenges.

**UPDATE:** Completed the two part exercises on day 3. I'm aware the solution could be taxing. Especially with large input file. I forgot to sort the tuples but then it'd be irrelevant with the shortcuts I took.

## Day 2:

I'm supposed to be on Day 3, but I'm a day behind. Just completed this exercise right before midnight of Day 4. The puzzle was very good. Although, Part 2 tricked me. I incorrectly answered it the first time, because I didn't read carefully.

## Day 3:

I completed this puzzle on the morning of Day 5. The 2nd part was nerve-wracking as it'd be harder to debug if I got something wrong. I figured it's finally time I write my first function in this adventure for that problem as it's more appropriate to do so. I simply converted my part 1 solution into a function. Technically, I could've solved the problem a day sooner, but the indices threw me off. To debug, I actually had to map out the output with `X` and `O` to see if the slope is lining up which was tedious.

## Day 4:

Admittedly, I've been rusty with Python as I'm not a dev and I haven't code in a while. Today on Day 5, I finally got a chance to use list comprehensions. However, I wasted most of my day trying to figure how some of the codes can be better re-written. My advice to you... Don't let that get to you. Just move on and use all the lines available to you. I gave up much later in the day, copied and pasted duplicated lines I wrote. Those exercises are by far the most challenging.
